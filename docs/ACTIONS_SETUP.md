# Set up LocalTerminal Lite as a GPT Action

[中文](ACTIONS_SETUP.zh-CN.md) · [Recommended GPT instructions](GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) · [Short prompt playbook](PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md) · [Privacy](PRIVACY.md)

This guide takes a new computer from installation to a tested private GPT. It uses LocalTerminal Lite 1.0.1 and the ChatGPT web editor. OpenAI currently limits GPT creation/editing to the web experience and eligible paid or managed-workspace users. A GPT can use **Apps or Actions, not both at the same time**. See OpenAI's [GPT creation guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt) and [Actions configuration guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9442513).

```

## 1. Install and start Lite

No Git, Node.js, or Bun installation is required beforehand.

### macOS

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wyj-IIRtyj/localterminal-lite/v1.0.1/scripts/install-macos.sh)"
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wyj-IIRtyj/localterminal-lite/v1.0.1/scripts/install-windows.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer downloads Bun when needed, downloads the tagged Lite source without Git, installs locked dependencies, registers `localterminal-lite` in the current user's PATH, and opens the TUI. Review the scripts before running them if your organization restricts remote scripts. For every later launch, open a new terminal and run only:

```text
localterminal-lite
```

On first launch, complete the TUI form:

1. choose `en` or `zh-CN` and a theme;
2. choose the project directory ChatGPT may access;
3. keep host `127.0.0.1` and port `3210` unless that port is occupied;
4. leave the public URL local for now;
5. accept or adjust output and command limits;
6. keep the generated Apps connector key and Actions token.

All later configuration is available from **6 Settings** with `c`. Do not edit a configuration file manually.

Visual check: the header says `running`; the Overview page shows exactly three exposed facade tools and masked connection credentials.

![LocalTerminal Lite settings](assets/tui/settings-en.svg)

The Settings page is the single source of truth for the workspace, listening address, public URL, limits, and masked credentials.

## 2. Give Actions an HTTPS endpoint

ChatGPT cannot call `127.0.0.1`. For a quick private test, run a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel in a second terminal. Cloudflare documents Quick Tunnels as development/testing only; use a named tunnel and stable hostname for long-lived use.

### Install cloudflared on macOS without Homebrew

```bash
case "$(uname -m)" in
  arm64) CF_ARCH=arm64 ;;
  x86_64) CF_ARCH=amd64 ;;
  *) echo "Unsupported macOS architecture"; exit 1 ;;
esac
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-darwin-${CF_ARCH}.tgz" -o /tmp/cloudflared.tgz
tar -xzf /tmp/cloudflared.tgz -C /tmp
sudo install /tmp/cloudflared /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
cloudflared --version
```

If Homebrew is already installed, `brew install cloudflared` is the shorter official command.

### Install cloudflared on Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$CloudflaredDir = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "cloudflared"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $CloudflaredDir | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile (Join-Path $CloudflaredDir "cloudflared.exe")
& (Join-Path $CloudflaredDir "cloudflared.exe") --version
```

Start the tunnel. Replace `3210` only if the TUI shows another port.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3210
```

Windows, if the executable is not on `PATH`:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\cloudflared\cloudflared.exe" tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3210
```

Copy the generated `https://...trycloudflare.com` URL. In Lite, open **6 Settings**, press `c`, set **Public HTTPS URL** to that URL, and complete the form. Lite restarts safely with the new base URL. Cloudflare's official [Quick Tunnel guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) explains the random hostname and testing-only limitation.

> Keep both Lite and `cloudflared` running. A Quick Tunnel URL changes after restart; update the TUI public URL and re-import the Action schema when it changes.

## 3. Create and describe the GPT

Open [chatgpt.com/gpts/editor](https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor) in a desktop browser. Choose the configuration view and enter a clear name and description.

![GPT configuration fields](assets/actions/gpt-config-en.jpg)

1. **Name:** `LocalTerminal Lite Developer`
2. **Description:** `Works on one local project through auditable Lite sessions, collaboration messages, checkpoints, and extensions.`
3. **Instructions:** paste the complete block from [Recommended GPT instructions](GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
4. **Conversation starters:** add two or three entries from the [short prompt playbook](PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md).

## 4. Create the Action

Scroll to **Actions** and choose **Create new action**.

![Create a new GPT Action](assets/actions/add-action-en.jpg)

The Action surface intentionally has only three operations:

| Action operation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `extensionDiscover` | Bootstrap identity or discover the authenticated concrete-tool catalog. |
| `extensionCall` | Run one concrete tool such as `session_register`, `read_file`, or `message_send`. |
| `extensionRegister` | Validate/upsert/remove a declarative custom extension; never create a session. |

## 5. Import the OpenAPI schema

Choose **Import from URL** and enter:

```text
https://YOUR-PUBLIC-HOST/openapi.json
```

For a Quick Tunnel this looks like:

```text
https://random-words.trycloudflare.com/openapi.json
```

![Import the OpenAPI schema](assets/actions/import-schema-en.jpg)

The current document is OpenAPI `3.1.0`; `components.schemas` is a JSON object. The editor should show the three operation IDs above. Do not paste the Apps MCP URL here, and do not append the hidden Apps connector key.

## 6. Configure Bearer authentication

In the Action editor, open **Authentication**:

1. choose **API Key**;
2. paste the **Actions token** from Lite's Settings page;
3. choose **Bearer**;
4. save.

![Configure the Actions Bearer token](assets/actions/authentication-en.jpg)

Press `v` in Lite Settings only when you intend to reveal credentials. The screenshot uses `[HIDDEN]`; never commit a real token.

Three values serve different purposes:

| Value | Where it goes | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actions token | GPT editor → Authentication → API Key/Bearer | Authenticates HTTP requests to the three facade endpoints. |
| `sessionId + sessionToken` | Top-level `identity` in authenticated Action calls | Identifies the current auditable Lite work session. |
| `claimCode` | `input` of one `session_inherit` call | One-time claim or handoff; it is not a reusable token. |

Never put a session token or claim code into the GPT editor's Authentication field.

## 7. Test in Preview

Keep the GPT private while testing. Send:

```text
Start a new root session for inspecting this project. Report the workspace summary, then checkpoint as waiting.
```

Expected sequence:

1. `extensionDiscover` without identity returns bootstrap guidance only.
2. `extensionCall` invokes `session_register` with `input.mode="root"`.
3. The GPT retains the returned `sessionId + sessionToken` internally.
4. Authenticated discovery exposes the concrete catalog.
5. `workspace_info` runs through `extensionCall` with top-level `identity`.
6. `session_checkpoint` records a summary and `waiting` phase before the answer ends.

Next, test collaboration:

```text
Delegate a read-only project-structure review and give me the handoff prompt for a second ChatGPT chat.
```

Paste the returned handoff prompt into a separate GPT conversation. The child must call `session_inherit` before work. Lite's Sessions page should show the continuation chain inside one logical card and delegated children as indented nodes.

## 8. Save and share deliberately

Create/save the GPT as **Only me** first. OpenAI may ask users to approve Actions before execution. If you later share by link or publish to the GPT Store, OpenAI requires a valid privacy-policy URL for a GPT with Actions. Adapt the [privacy template](PRIVACY.md) to the way you operate the GPT and host it at a stable public URL; the repository policy describes the unhosted Lite software, not every third-party deployment.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `Input should be '3.1.1' or '3.1.0'` | Update Lite, import the exact `/openapi.json` URL, and remove any stale pasted schema. |
| `components.schemas ... is not an object` | You are using an older or altered schema. Lite 1.0.1 returns a concrete object. Re-import from the running service. |
| `spec must be an object` | `extensionRegister` needs top-level `spec:{...}`. Session creation belongs to `extensionCall` with `tool:"session_register"`. |
| `input.name is required`, `input.to is required`, or `input.body is required` | Put concrete arguments inside `extensionCall.input`, for example `{tool:"message_send", input:{to:"reviewer", body:"Ready"}, identity:{...}}`. |
| `IDENTITY_REQUIRED` | Create a root or inherit a handed-off session, then include the returned identity on every authenticated call. |
| `INVALID_IDENTITY` | If the same conversation became stale after interruption, call session_inherit with the previous sessionToken to reclaim the original session. For release/revoke/handoff, obtain a fresh claimCode from the TUI. Do not create a new root for the same unfinished task. |
| `CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED` | Call `session_checkpoint` before ordinary work continues. |
| `CHILD_REVIEW_REQUIRED` | Review the returned child summaries/messages/events and finish or cancel every child. |
| Schema URL cannot be reached | Verify Lite and the tunnel are both running, then open `https://YOUR-HOST/health` and `/openapi.json` in a browser. |
| HTTP 401 | Re-enter the Lite **Actions token** as API Key → Bearer. Do not use the Apps connector key. |

## Security boundary

The selected workspace is writable by the GPT through the facade. Use a dedicated project directory, review the Diff and Logs pages, keep credentials masked, and stop the tunnel when remote access is not needed. Quick Tunnels publish the local HTTP service to a public random hostname; the Actions Bearer token is therefore mandatory.
